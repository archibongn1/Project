You can find the explanations of these directory contents in the `project-A-stage-topics.pdf` except the `PyPI` and `Syntax and Semantics.`

## Python

* This directory contains the files that students can use to understand Python from SE perspectives. 
* Students can use Jupyter to add, test, and document Python programming. 

### Decorator

* The Python programs in this directory explains how the Decorator design pattern is used in Python.
* The Decorator design pattern is critical in understanding how Flask matches users' input to Python methods.
* The Decorators.ipynb is an example of how one can use Jupyter to understand the Decorator pattern in Python. 

### Package

* The idea of the package is one of the possible implementations of the `module` concept.
* Package in Python is particularly important as it contains many of SE design ideas. 
* The three package examples enable students to understand the Python Package ideas step by step. 

### PyDoc

* Documentation is one of the most important SE topics. 
* Python allows us to integrate documentation and Python code using PyDoc. 

### Tests

Python provides the following tools for testing Python code.

#### DocTest

* Python enables us to integrate documentation and testing using DocTest. 

#### UnitTest

* Python provides unittest package as a default library. Students can use higher-level test framework such as [nose](nose python GitHub) or [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

#### WebServer

* The `webserver.py` is a python application that works as the simplest web server. 

### PyPI

* You can find the explanations of these directory contents in the `project-D-stage-topics.pdf`
* This directory has a Python module/library that students can upload to PyPI repository. 
* Students can use Jupyter to learn semantics and syntax of Python interactively. 

### Syntax and Semantics

* This directory contains seven Python topics to learn interactively and progressively with Jupyter. 

## Flask

* This directory contains the Python Flask application files. 
* Students can learn Flask and Jinja by executing the applications from 1a to 3b. 

## Markdown

* This directory contains how students can use `pandoc` to generate various files from a single markdown source. 
* The Riki uses Markdown as the base file format. 
* So, it will help students to finish the project effectively when they understand how they use Markdown file format and tools. 

## Riki

* This directory contains the source code of the Riki Wiki system.
